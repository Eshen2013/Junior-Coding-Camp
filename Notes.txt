Variables are containers that are used to store data.

How to declare variable in Python?
To declare a variable in Python simply assign a value to it.
Example
name = "Pikachu"

#Program 1 
name = "Pikachu"
print(name)

#Legal variable names
myvar = "codingguruba"
my_var = "codingguruba"
_my_var = "codingguruba"
myVar = "codingguruba"
MYVAR = "codingguruba"
myvar2 = "codinguruba"

#Program 2

pokemon_name = "Pikachu"
pokemon_type = "Electric"
pokemon_color = "Yellow"
pokemon_speed = 25

print(pokemon_name)
print(pokemon_type)
print(pokemon_color)
print(pokemon_speed)


Data Types 
String - 
In Python, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed within either single quotes ' ' or double quotes " "
Strings can contain letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces
Example - "Hello world" , "Nepal" , "Apple" , "Ramesh", "Neharika"

integers - Numbers negative 0 or positive. 18 ,200 , 4 ,


Program 

pokemon_name = "Pikachu"
pokemon_type = "electric"
pokemon_speed = 100

print("Name:",pokemon_name)
print("Type:",pokemon_type)
print("Speed:",pokemon_speed)

print(type(pokemon_name))
print(type(pokemon_type))
print(type(pokemon_speed))

Comments in Python - Comments  can be used to explain Python code. Comment is not executed
Comments starts with  # 
Example of a comment
#This is comment and it doesn't get printed
print("Welcome to python")

Data types are classifications that categorize various types of data that can be used in programming
int - Integer type represents whole numbers without any fractional part.
float - Floating-point type represents numbers with a fractional part
String -  String type represents sequences of  characters, used for text manipulation.

a = 5
print(type(a))

In Python, the type() function is used to get the data type of an object

Python Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

Operator	Name	Example	Try it
+	Addition	x + y	
-	Subtraction	x - y	
*	Multiplication	x * y	
/	Division	x / y	
%	Modulus	x % y
**	Exponentiation

Python Casting - Converting one data type into another

import math

radius = 2

area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)

print("The area of the circle is:", area)

Booleans represent one of two values: True or False.
print(10 > 9)
print(10 == 9)
print(10 < 9)

#Program

length1 = int(input("Enter length:"))
breadth1 = int(input("Enter breadth:"))
a1 = length1*breadth1
print("Area of rectangle 1 is:",a1)
print("\nFor Rectangle 2......")
length2 = int(input("Enter length:"))
breadth2 = int(input("Enter breadth:"))
a2 = length2*breadth2
print("Area of rectangle 2 is:",a2)

if(a1>a2):
    print(a1,"is greater")
    
else:
    print(a2,"is greater")



Comparison operators are used to compare two values:
Equal to (==): Checks if two values are equal.
Not equal to (!=):
Greater than (>):
Less than (<): 
Less than or equal to (<=):

User Input
Python allows for user input.
That means we are able to ask the user for input.
User input in Python can be obtained using the input() function.



A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:

def my_function():
  print("Hello")


In Python, the import statement is used to bring in modules or packages into your current Python script 
or interactive session.

import math

print(math.sqrt(25))  # Square root function
print(math.pi)         

import math

# Calculate the square root of 25
sqrt_result = math.sqrt(25)
print("Square root of 25:", sqrt_result)

# Calculate the factorial of 5
factorial_result = math.factorial(5)
print("Factorial of 5:", factorial_result)


import math

# Calculate the area of a circle with radius 5
radius = 5
circle_area = math.pi * radius ** 2
print("Area of circle with radius 5:", circle_area)

A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
A for loop can to used to repeat a block of code.
